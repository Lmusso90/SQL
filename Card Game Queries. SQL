I used the data table (from the link above) to practice querying the following: 

What are average, max, and min values in the data?
What about those numbers per category in the data (using HAVING)?
What ways are there to group the data values that donâ€™t exist yet (using CASE)?
What interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)?



                              /*AS*/

SELECT game_name AS 'games' FROM card_games GROUP BY game_name;



                        /*MIN,MAX,AVG*/

SELECT game_name,player_name, MAX(score) FROM card_games GROUP BY game_name;

SELECT game_name,player_name, MIN(score) FROM card_games GROUP BY game_name;

SELECT game_name, ROUND(AVG(score)) AS'AVG_score' FROM
card_games GROUP BY game_name;

SELECT game_name, MAX(score), MIN(score) FROM card_games GROUP BY game_name;

SELECT game_name, MAX(score), MIN(score) FROM card_games WHERE game_name ='Go Fish'; 


                           /*HAVING*/

SELECT player_name, game_name, Score FROM card_games GROUP BY player_name HAVING score >300;


                            /*OR*/

SELECT Date_played,player_name, game_name FROM card_games WHERE game_name = 'Go Fish'OR game_name = 'Pitch' GROUP BY date_played;


                            /*AND*/

SELECT* FROM card_games WHERE game_name= 'Rummy' AND score >=200 GROUP BY Player_name;


                            /*CASE*/

SELECT score FROM card_games WHERE game_name = 'Rummy' ORDER BY score DESC;

SELECT Date_played, player_name, score AS 'Rummy_Score',
CASE
WHEN score >500 THEN 'ALL STAR'
WHEN score >400 THEN 'PRO'
WHEN score >300 THEN 'OKAY'
ELSE 'You_stink'
END AS 'score_rankings'
FROM card_games
WHERE game_name= 'Rummy'
GROUP BY score ORDER By player_name;



                                                    /*COUNT*/

SELECT COUNT(game_name)AS 'Times_Winston_played_Rummy' FROM card_games WHERE game_name='Rummy' AND player_name ='Winston';
